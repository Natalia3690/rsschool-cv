#### Purpose and priorities

Here, in rsschool I’m to study and to see how I can contribute to development. For that purpose the best way is training.

Usually, I go into detail, scrupulous, try to complete any deal. I feel rather easy in multitasking due to ranking by urgency level.

#### Work experience and skills

* I worked as a client manager for the last couple of years (client-oriented approach)
* Used to work as a call-center operator (stress-resistance, problem-solving)

Unfortunately, I have no experience in development for now, but I hope it will be in future.

During study in rsschool I’ve learnt **HTML course** for beginners at [https://ru.code-basics.com/languages/html](https://ru.code-basics.com/languages/html).

>As an example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ru">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title> Сказки народов мира </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Сказки</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Алиса в стране чудес</li>
            <li>Винни-пух</li>
            <li>Дюймовочка</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```
