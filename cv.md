#### Purpose and priorities
Here, in rsschool I’m to study and to see how I can contribute to development. For that purpose the best way is training.

Usually, I go into detail, scrupulous, try to complete any deal. I feel rather easy in multitasking due to ranking by urgency level.
#### Work experience and skills
<ul>
<li>I worked as a client manager for the last couple of years (client-oriented approach)</li>
<li>Used to work as a call-center operator (stress-resistance, problem-solving)</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, I have no experience in development for now, but I hope it will be in future.

During study in rsschool I’ve learnt **HTML course** for beginners at [https://ru.code-basics.com/languages/html](https://ru.code-basics.com/languages/html).

>As an example:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="ru">

<head>

<meta charset="UTF-8">

<title> Сказки народов мира </title>

</head>

<body>

<h1>Сказки</h1>

<ul>

<li>Алиса в стране чудес</li>

<li>Винни-пух</li>

<li>Дюймовочка</li>

</ul>

</body>
